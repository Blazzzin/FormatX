                With our PDF Merge tool, combining multiple PDF files into a single document has never been easier.
                Simply follow these steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Upload Your Files:</strong> Click the "Upload Files" button to select multiple PDF files
                    from your device. You can select a maximum of 20 files from your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Arrange the Files:</strong> Once the files are uploaded, you can easily reorder them by
                    dragging and dropping. Arrange them in the sequence you want the final document to appear.</li>
                <li><strong>Preview the Files:</strong> Each file has a little preview of the first page so that you
                    know you are confidently rearranging the correct file in the correct order.</li>
                <li><strong>Merge the PDFs:</strong> When you're happy with the order and the previews, simply click the
                    "Merge PDFs" button to combine all selected files into a single PDF.</li>
                <li><strong>Download the Final Document:</strong> Once the merge is complete, the final newly merged PDF
                    will be downloaded onto your device!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This tool is perfect for combining contracts, reports, or any collection of PDF documents into one
                convenient file. Whether youâ€™re managing work documents or personal files, our simple and intuitive
                interface will help you get the job done in just a few clicks!
